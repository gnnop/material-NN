This is intended to be an ML file ready for public release.
I'm going to spend some time on implementation difficulties and code compactness.



The dataset names are obvious.

All data is loaded into the data subfolder after processing.
Model-parameters are hashed into the models subfolder


To get the unpacking stuff to work, you have to unzip the csv's first.





Please note that the embedder I have currently is useless.
